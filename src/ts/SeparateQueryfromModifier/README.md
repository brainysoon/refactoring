#Separate Query from Modifier

##Motivation

When you have a function that gives you a value and has no observable side effects, you have a very valuable thing. You can call this function as often as you like. You can move the call to other places in the method. In short, you have a lot less to worry about.


It is a good idea to clearly signal the difference between methods with side effects and those without. A good rule to follow is to say that any method that returns a value should not have observable side effects. Some programmers treat this as an absolute rule [Meyer]. Iâ€™m not 100 percent pure on this (as on anything), but I try to follow it most of the time, and it has served me well.
