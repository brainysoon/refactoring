#Parameterize Method

##Motivation:
Several methods do similar things but with different values contained in the method body.
Create one method that uses a parameter for the different values.

##Steps:
1.Create a parameterized method that can be substituted for each repetitive method. 
2.Replace one old method with a call to the new method
3.Repeat for all the methods
4.Compile and test after each change.
